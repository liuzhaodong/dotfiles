"------------------------------------------------------------
" Must have options
"
" These are highly recommended options.

" One of the most important options to activate. Allows you to switch from an
" unsaved buffer without saving it first. Also allows you to keep an undo
" history for multiple files. Vim will complain if you try to quit without
" saving, and swap files will keep you safe if your computer crashes.
set hidden

" Note that not everyone likes working this way (with the hidden option).
" Alternatives include using tabs or split windows instead of re-using the same
" window for multiple buffers, and/or:
" set confirm
" set autowriteall

" Better command-line completion
set wildmenu

" Show partial commands in the last line of the screen
set showcmd

" Do not highlight searches by default
" (the vim-unimpaired plugin provides `coh` to toggle this when needed)
" (my <Space> mapping below also temporarily turns off highlighting)
set nohlsearch

" Modelines have historically been a source of security vulnerabilities.  As
" such, it may be a good idea to disable them and use the securemodelines
" script, <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1876>.
" set nomodeline


" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Backups

" don't keep swp files
set noswapfile


"------------------------------------------------------------
" Usability options
"
" These are options that users frequently set in their .vimrc. Some of them
" change Vim's behaviour in ways which deviate from the true Vi way, but
" which are considered to add usability. Which, if any, of these options to
" use is very much a personal preference, but they are harmless.

" Use case insensitive search, except when using capital letters
set ignorecase
set smartcase

" Incremental search
set incsearch

" Set the search scan to wrap around the file
set wrapscan

" Allow backspacing over autoindent, line breaks and start of insert action
set backspace=indent,eol,start

" When opening a new line and no filetype-specific indenting is enabled, keep
" the same indent as the line you're currently on. Useful for READMEs, etc.
set autoindent

" Stop certain movements from always going to the first character of a line.
" While this behaviour deviates from that of Vi, it does what most users
" coming from other editors would expect.
set nostartofline

" Display the cursor position on the last line of the screen or in the status
" line of a window
set ruler

" Always display the status line, even if only one window is displayed
set laststatus=2

" Instead of failing a command because of unsaved changes, instead raise a
" dialogue asking if you wish to save changed files.
set confirm

" Use visual bell instead of beeping when doing something wrong
set visualbell

" And reset the terminal code for the visual bell.  If visualbell is set, and
" this line is also included, vim will neither flash nor beep.  If visualbell
" is unset, this does nothing.
set t_vb=

" Enable use of the mouse for all modes
" set mouse=a

" Set the command window height to 2 lines, to avoid many cases of having to
" 'press <Enter> to continue'
" set cmdheight=2

set notimeout ttimeout ttimeoutlen=200

" Use <F11> to toggle between 'paste' and 'nopaste'
